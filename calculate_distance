To calculate how long it takes to do a journey you could use the 
following algorithm:


TimeDeparted = 15:00
TimeArrived = 16:00

Drivetime = TimeArrived - TimeDeparted


This is an example of pseudo-code, which is a way of expressing the 
algorithm without having to use any specific programming language. 
The start point for programmers is often to work out what algorithms are 
needed to solve a problem and then to write these in pseudo-code during 
the planning stage. This can be a time-consuming process depending on 
the complexity of the solution.

When all of the procedures have been identified, the pseudo-code can 
be converted into proper programming code using whatever language is 
considered the most appropriate for solving the problem.
