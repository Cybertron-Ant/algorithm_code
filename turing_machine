To represent programs in Turing machines you need:
● a start state – the state of the machine at the start of the program
● a halting state – the state that will stop the program running
● an alphabet – this is a list of the acceptable symbols that can go into each cell
● movement – the ability to move the head so that you can read/write to
every cell
