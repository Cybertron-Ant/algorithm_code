Time: how long does the algorithm take to run compared to other
algorithms.

Space: how much space (memory) is required by the algorithm compared
to other algorithms.


The key consideration is what is called input size or problem size. Typically 
this is the number of parameters or values that the algorithm will be 
working on. For example, a search routine written to work on a dataset 
with only a few values may not work as efficiently on a larger dataset with 
hundreds of values.
