● An O(1) algorithm scales the best as it never takes any longer to run.
● An O(logN) algorithm is the next most efficient.
● An O(N) algorithm is the next most efficient.
● An O(N2) algorithm is a polynomial and is considered to be the point
beyond which algorithms start to become intractable. Note that the
superscript number could be any value.
● An O(2N) algorithm is the least efficient and considered intractable.
