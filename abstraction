This is the process of removing unnecessary details until it is possible to represent the problem in a way that can be solved. This level of abstraction
could be described as viewing the ‘big picture’ – working out what is
relevant to solving the problem and what is unnecessary detail that can be
ignored.
With the satnav problem, at a basic level, the problem can be reduced to
finding the shortest distance between point A and point B. An abstraction
of that would be to:


● identify point A and point B in some way
● identify the connecting paths between A and B
