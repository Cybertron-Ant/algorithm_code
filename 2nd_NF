Second normal form is achieved by ensuring the database is in first normal 
form and then removing attributes that depend upon part but not all of the 
primary key by creating additional tables.



The non-key attributes are all the other attributes apart from the primary 
key. For example, Address, DateOfDownload, Genre and

dependent on the CustomerID, but not on the MovieID. Similarly, the 
Genre is dependent on the MovieID but not on the CustomerID. So,
