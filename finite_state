A finite state machine (FSM) is any device that can 
store its current status (or state) and can change state based on an 
input. The FSM may receive further inputs, which in turn change the 
state again.

This shows the dependency of one state on the next. If the username is 
correct it can change to the next state. If the password is correct it can move 
on to the accepting state. Without the correct inputs the state will not change.
