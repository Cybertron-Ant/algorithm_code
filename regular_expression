● (a|b|c)d*e would produce the following possible strings: ade, ae, be, bde,
ce and cde. There could in fact be an infinite number of the letter ‘d’ but
it would have to end in an e.
● (a+(b|c))d would produce abd or aabd or aaabd (and so on with the
preceding ‘a’) or the ‘b’ could be replaced by a ‘c’ in each string
